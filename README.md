# :wave: Oi!

I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Avenue Code](https://www.avenuecode.com/).

I have 3 years of full stack web development experience mostly in accounting, financial and retail sectors. Currently seeking an opportunity to work for companies at scale and with teams that prioritize technical excellence and professional growth. Passionate about software development and technology in general, curious by nature and eager to learn new skills.

Outside my working hours I like to read a lot about technology and software engineering, listen to music and play some games.
